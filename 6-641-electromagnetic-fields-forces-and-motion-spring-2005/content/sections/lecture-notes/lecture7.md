description: Lecture notes on polarization, conduction, the dipole model of polarization,
  equipotential sphere in a uniform electric field, artificial dielectric, plasma
  conduction model (classical), relationship between resistance and capacitance in
  uniform media, change relaxation in uniform conductors, relaxation of charge on
  particle in Ohmic conductor, self-excited water dynamos, conservation of charge
  boundary condition, and Maxwell's capacitor.
